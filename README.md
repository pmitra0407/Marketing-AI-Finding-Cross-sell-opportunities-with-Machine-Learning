A consumer bank wants to cross-sell its insurance product (Personal Protection Plan/ PPI) to customers, who have secured or unsecured type of loan. Now with the help of marketing artificial intelligence, depending on the customerâ€™s historical behaviors and portfolio, the bank wants to apply analytics and marketing AI to decide:

1. Who is likely to buy their insurance product, finding the right customer?
2. What type of PPI insurance product should be targeted to whom, finding the right product?
