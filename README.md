A consumer bank wants to cross-sell its insurance product (Personal Protection Plan/ PPI) to customers, who have secured or unsecured type of loan. Now with the help of marketing artificial intelligence, depending on the customerâ€™s historical behaviors and portfolio, the bank wants to apply analytics and marketing AI to decide:

Who is likely to buy their insurance product, finding the right customer?
What type of PPI insurance product should be targeted to whom, finding the right product?
Now the bank has provided the customer data with the following features like credit score, outstanding loan amount, residential status, demographic information like age group, income group, etc, and finally if the customer is already holding any insurance and if yes then what type of insurance product, etc.
